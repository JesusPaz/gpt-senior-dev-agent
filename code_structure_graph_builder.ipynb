    "We want to give GPT (or any LLM) the ability to:\n",

    "- 🔍 **Tree-sitter** to parse and structure the codebase\n",
    "- 🧠 **LLMs** to describe each function or class (aka \"requirements\")\n",
    "- 🕸️ **Code graphs** to represent dependencies (calls, imports, etc)\n",

    "1. **Requirement Graph**  \n",
    "   A graph where each node is a *natural language description* of a function or class. Edges represent semantic similarity or parent-child relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DS-Code Graph**  \n",
    "   A code graph that encodes structural dependencies like:\n",
    "   - function calls\n",
    "   - class inheritance\n",
    "   - file/module containment\n",
    "   - semantic similarity (via embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BiGraph Mapping**  \n",
    "   Links between requirements and code elements — allowing retrieval of relevant code given a high-level prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Agentic Reasoning**  \n",
    "   An LLM-driven reasoning loop that dynamically:\n",
    "   - queries the graph\n",
    "   - follows dependencies\n",
    "   - does web search if needed\n",
